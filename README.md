These are some codes I wrote as a part of a study project in the Mathematics department at BITS Pilani.

As a part of this project, a fellow student(Abhishek) and I studied the discontinuous Gelerking finite element formulation. We coded the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin Method (SIPG) and Non-Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin Method (NIPG) for the Poisson equation in FreeFem++

For details, one may refer to the attached report and presentation. (The report includes some matlab codes as well. But we gave up the idea of coding in matlab and switched to FreeFem++ instead. So I have only included the FreeFem++ codes.)
